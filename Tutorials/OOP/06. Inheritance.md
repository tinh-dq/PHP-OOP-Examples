# 6. Inheritance

Inheritance in OOP = When a class derives from another class.

The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class. In addition, it can have its own properties and methods.

An inherited class is defined by using the extends keyword.

```
<?php
class Fruit {
  public $name;
  public $color;
  public function __construct($name, $color) {
    $this->name = $name;
    $this->color = $color;
  }
  protected function intro() {
    echo "The fruit is {$this->name} and the color is {$this->color}.";
  }
}

class Strawberry extends Fruit {
  public function message() {
    echo "Am I a fruit or a berry? ";
  }
}

// Try to call all three methods from outside class
$strawberry = new Strawberry("Strawberry", "red");  // OK. __construct() is public
$strawberry->message(); // OK. message() is public
$strawberry->intro(); // ERROR. intro() is protected
?>
```

In the example above we see that if we try to call a protected method (intro()) from outside the class, we will receive an error. public methods will work fine!

## Override method:

```
<?php
class Fruit {
  public $name;
  public $color;
  public function __construct($name, $color) {
    $this->name = $name;
    $this->color = $color;
  }
  public function intro() {
    echo "The fruit is {$this->name} and the color is {$this->color}.";
  }
}

class Strawberry extends Fruit {
  public $weight;
  public function __construct($name, $color, $weight) {
    $this->name = $name;
    $this->color = $color;
    $this->weight = $weight;
  }
  public function intro() {
    echo "The fruit is {$this->name}, the color is {$this->color}, and the weight is {$this->weight} gram.";
  }
}

$strawberry = new Strawberry("Strawberry", "red", 50);
$strawberry->intro(); // The fruit is Strawberry, the color is red, and the weight is 50 gram.
?>
```
## The final Keyword

The final keyword can be used to prevent class inheritance or to prevent method overriding.

```
<?php
final class Fruit {
  // some code
}

// will result in error
class Strawberry extends Fruit {
  // some code
}
?>
```

```
<?php
class Fruit {
  final public function intro() {
    // some code
  }
}

class Strawberry extends Fruit {
  // will result in error
  public function intro() {
    // some code
  }
}
?>
```
