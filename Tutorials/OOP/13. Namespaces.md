# 13. Namespaces

Namespaces are qualifiers that solve two different problems:

* They allow for better organization by grouping classes that work together to perform a task
* They allow the same name to be used for more than one class


```
<?php
namespace Html;
class Table {
  public $title = "";
  public $numRows = 0;

  public function message() {
    echo "<p>Table '{$this->title}' has {$this->numRows} rows.</p>";
  }
}

class Row {
  public $numCells = 0;
  public function message() {
    echo "<p>The row has {$this->numCells} cells.</p>";
  }
}
?>
```

```
<?php
include "Html.php";

$table = new Html\Table();
$table->title = "My table";
$table->numRows = 5;

$row = new Html\Row();
$row->numCells = 3;
?>

<html>
<body>

<?php $table->message(); ?>
<?php $row->message(); ?>

</body>
</html>
```
Output:

Table 'My table' has 5 rows.

The row has 3 cells.
